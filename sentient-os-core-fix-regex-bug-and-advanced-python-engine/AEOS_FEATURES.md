# AEOS - Autonomous Earth Operating System

## 🚀 Planetary Multi-Agent Intelligence on Masumi Network

AEOS is the world's first self-managing AI economy, designed to orchestrate both Earth-scale and Enterprise-scale automation through a unified intelligence layer.

### 🧠 The Superior AI: AEOS Orchestrator
At the core sits the **AEOS Orchestrator**, a master intelligence that:
1. **Analyzes Intent**: Deciphers complex user commands using advanced NLP.
2. **Delegates Tasks**: Routes requests to one of 4 specialized Intelligence Divisions.
3. **Manages Collaboration**: Detects when agents need to hire each other (e.g., Compliance Agent triggering a DeFi block).
4. **Optimizes Resources**: Balances computation and cost across the Masumi Network.
